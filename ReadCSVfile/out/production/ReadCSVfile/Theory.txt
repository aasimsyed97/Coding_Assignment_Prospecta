Theoretical Challenge

Suppose you have a CSV file with the data below.

A1: 5, A2: 7, A3: 9, B1: 3, B2: 8, B3: =4+5, C1: =5+A1, C2: =A2+B2, C3: =C2+B3

This can be represented in an excel sheet below:

I want a program that will take the CSV input above and produce CSV output with the results.  If it is a value, then return a value.  If it is a formula then calculate the formula and return the value of that formula.

How will you tackle the challenge above?
What type of errors you would you check for?
How might a user break your code?

Answer1:  The CSV files are the files which are separated by Comma. CSV stands for COMA SEPARATED VALUES.
         when we required to transfer tabular data between two programs we use CSV file format.
         The default separator of a CSV file is a comma (,).
          so, Reading CSV file we can achieve that following ways.
          1.  Java Scanner class.
          2. Java String.split() method.

Answer2: We will check for NumberFormatException also as there are some mathematical operations we will check for
          Arithmetic exceptions too.


 Answer3:  1} incorrect reference or path of csv file.
           2} incorrect format inside csv file.
           3}
